## Problem 1: Single-Feature Regression
- Three separate gradient descent models were developed for x1, x2, and x3.
- Three learning rates (0.1, 0.05, and 0.01) were tested to compare convergence behavior.
- Plots of regression lines and loss curves helped determine which variable best predicts y.
- Analysis shows that the choice of learning rate is critical for balancing convergence speed and stability.

## Problem 2: Multi-Feature Regression
- A multi-feature regression model was built using all three explanatory variables.
- The effect of different learning rates was explored, and the model with the lowest final loss was selected.
- Loss curves and prediction on new data [(1,1,1), (2,0,4), (3,2,1)] illustrate the modelâ€™s performance.
- The experiments underscore the importance of choosing an appropriate learning rate for effective convergence.
